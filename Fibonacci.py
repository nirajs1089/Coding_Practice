The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers where each number after the first two is a sum of the prior two. As an illustration, here is a short sequence given starting values of (0, 1) is (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13).

 

You will be given an integer n and must calculate the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence given starting elements of (0, 1). Return an array with all of the values in ascending order.
