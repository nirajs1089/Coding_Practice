You are given an array of integers and must compute the maximum difference between any item and any lower indexed smaller item for all the possible pairs, i.e., for a given array a find the maximum value of a[j] - a[i] for all i, j where 0 ≤ i < j < n and a[i] < a[j]. If there are no lower indexed smaller items for all the items, then return -1.

 

For example, given an array [ 1, 2, 6, 4], you would first compare 2 to the elements to its left.  1 is smaller, so calculate the difference 2 - 1 = 1.  6 is bigger than 2 and 1, so calculate the differences 4 and 5.  4 is only bigger than 2 and 1, and the differences are 2 and 3.  The largest difference was 6 - 1 = 5.

 

Function Description 

Complete the function maxDifference in the editor below. The function must return an integer representing the maximum difference in a.

 

maxDifference has the following parameter(s):

    a[a[0],a[1],...a[n-1]]:  an array of integers

 

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 105
−106 ≤ a[i] ≤ 106 ∀ i ∈ [0, n − 1]
 

Input Format For Custom Testing
Input from stdin will be processed as follows and passed to the function:

 

The first line contains a single integer, n, denoting the number of elements in the array a.

Each of the n subsequent lines contains a single integer describing element a[i] where 0 ≤ i < n.

Sample Output

8
Explanation

n = 7, a = [2, 3, 10, 2, 4, 8, 1]

 

Differences are calculated as:

3 - [2] = [1]
10 - [3, 2] = [7, 8]
4 - [2, 3, 2] = [2, 1, 2]
8 - [4, 2, 3, 2] = [4, 6, 5, 6]
 

The maximum is found at 10 - 2 = 8.

Explanation

n = 6, a = [7, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2]

 

Differences are calculated as:

9 - [7] = 2
6 - [5] = 1
 

The maximum difference is 2.
